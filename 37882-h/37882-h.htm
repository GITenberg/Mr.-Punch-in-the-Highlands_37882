<p><span class="smcap">Scotsmen</span>&mdash;Highlanders and Lowlanders&mdash;have furnished Mr. Punch with many
of his happiest jokes. Despite the curious tradition which the Cockney
imbibes with his mother's milk as to the sterility of Scotland in
humour, the Scots are not only the cause of humour in others but there
are occasions when they prove themselves not entirely bereft of the
faculty which, with his charming egoism, the Cockney supposes to be his
own exclusive birthright. Indeed, we have it on the authority of Mr.
Spielmann, the author of "The History of <i>Punch</i>", that "of the accepted
jokes from unattached contributors (to Punch), it is a notable fact that
at least 75 per cent. comes from north of the Tweed." As a very
considerable proportion of these Scottish jokes make fun of the national
characteristics of the Scot, it is clear that Donald has the supreme
gift of being able to laugh at himself. It should be noted, however,
that Mr. Punch's most celebrated Scottish joke ("Bang went saxpence"),
which we give on page 153, was no invention, but merely the record of an
actual conversation overheard by an Englishman!</p>

<p>In the present volume the purpose has been not so much to bring together
a representative collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> the Scottish humour that has appeared in
<i>Punch</i>, but to illustrate the intercourse of the "Sassenach" with the
Highlander, chiefly as a visitor bent on sport, and incidentally to
illustrate some of the humours of Highland life. Perhaps the distinction
between Highlander and Lowlander has not been very rigidly kept, but
that need trouble none but the pedants, who are notoriously lacking in
the sense of humour, and by that token ought not to be peeping into
these pages.</p>

<p>Of all Mr. Punch's contributors, we may say, without risk of being
invidious, that Charles Keene was by far the happiest in the portrayal
of Scottish character. His Highland types are perhaps somewhat closer to
the life than his Lowlanders, but all are invariably touched off with
the kindliest humour, and never in any way burlesqued. If his work
overshadows that of the other humorous artists past and present
represented in this volume, it is for the reason stated; yet it will be
found that from the days of John Leech to those of Mr. Raven-Hill, <span class="smcap">Mr.
Punch's</span> artists have seldom been more happily inspired than when they
have sought to depict Highland life and the lighter side of sport and
travel north of the Tweed.</p>

<p>The following are the notes we have received from our Sporting
Contributor. I wish we could say they were a fair equivalent for the
notes he has received from <i>us</i>, to say nothing of that new Henry's
patent double central-fire breech-loader, with all the latest
improvements, and one of Mr. Benjamin's heather-mixture suits. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> as
they are we print them, with the unsatisfactory consolation that if the
notes are bad they are like the sport and the birds. Of all these it may
be said that "bad is the best."</p>

<p><i>North and South Uist.</i>&mdash;The awfully hard weather&mdash;the natives call it
"soft" here&mdash;having rendered the chances of winged game out of the
question, the sportsmen who have rented the shootings are glad to try
the chances of the game, sitting, and have confined themselves to the
whist from which the islands take their name. Being only two, they are
reduced to double dummy. As the rental of the Uist Moors is £400, they
find the points come rather high&mdash;so far.</p>

<p><i>Harris.</i>&mdash;In spite of repeated inquiries, the proprietress of the
island was not visible. Her friend, Mrs. Gamp, now here on a visit,
declares she saw Mrs. H. very recently, but was quite unable to give me
any information as to shootings, except the shootings of her own corns.</p>

<p><i>Fifeshire.</i>&mdash;The renters of the Fife shootings generally have been
seriously considering the feasibility of combining with those of the
once well-stocked Drum Moor in Aberdeenshire, to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> up something like
a band&mdash;of hope, that a bag may be made some day. Thus far, the only
bags made have been those of the proprietors of the shootings, who have
bagged heavy rentals.</p>

<p><i>Rum.</i>&mdash;I call the island a gross-misnomer, as there is nothing to drink
in it but whiskey, which, with the adjacent "Egg", may be supposed to
have given rise to the neighbouring "Mull"&mdash;hot drinks being the natural
resource of both natives and visitors in such weather as we've had ever
since I crossed the Tweed. I have seen one bird&mdash;at least so the gilly
says&mdash;after six tumblers, but to me it had all the appearance of a
brace.</p>

<p><i>Skye.</i>&mdash;Birds wild. Sportsmen, ditto. Sky a gloomy grey&mdash;your
correspondent and the milk at the hotel at Corrieverrieslushin alike
sky-blue.</p>

<p><i>Cantire.</i>&mdash;Can't you? Try tramping the moors for eight hours after a
pack of preternaturally old birds that know better than let you get
within half a mile of their tails. Then see if you can't tire. I beg
your pardon, but if you knew what it was to make jokes under my present
circumstances, you'd give it up, or do worse. If I should not turn up
shortly, and you hear of an inquest on a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> man, in one of
Benjamin's heather-mixture suits, with a Henry's central-fire
breech-loader, and a roll of new notes in his possession, found hanging
wet through, in his braces in some remote Highland shieling&mdash;break it

he has been driving past an interminable series of lochs, to inquire
where the keys are kept? He had better apply to the local authorities in
the Isle of Man. They have a whole House of Keys. Possibly those the

<h2>FULL STOP IN THE DAWDLE FROM THE NORTH.</h2>

<center><i>(Leaves from the Highland Journal of Toby, M.P.)</i></center>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 25%">

</div>
<p>"Here's a go", I said, turning to Sark, after carefully looking round
the station to see if we really were back at Oban, having a quarter of
an hour ago started (as we supposed) on our journey, already fifteen
minutes late.</p>

<p>"Well, if you put it in that way", he said, "I should call it an entire
absence of go. I thought it was a peculiarly jolting train. Never passed
over so many points in the same time in my life."</p>

<p>"Looks as if we should miss train at Stirling", I remark, anxiously. "If
so, we can't get on from Carlisle to Woodside to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, that'll be all right," said Sark, airy to the last; "we'll make it
up as we go along."</p>

<p>Again sort of faint bluish light, which I had come to recognise as a
smile, feebly flashed over <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>cadaverous countenance of the stranger in
corner seat.</p>

<p>Certainly no hurry in getting off. More whistling, more waving of green
flag. Observed that natives who had come to see friends off had quietly
waited on platform. Train evidently expected back. Now it had returned
they said good-bye over again to friends. Train deliberately steams out
of station thirty-five minutes late. Every eight or ten miles stopped at
roadside station. No one got in or got out. After waiting five or six
minutes, to see if any one would change his mind, train crawled out
again. Performance repeated few miles further on with same result.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 20%">
<a href="images/i_018.png">
<img src="images/i_018.png" width="100%" alt="Cartoon dog" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Don't put your head out of the window and ask questions", Sark
remonstrated, as I banged down the window. "I never did it since I heard
a story against himself John Bright used to tell with great glee.
Travelling homeward one day in a particularly slow train, it stopped an
unconscionably long time at Oldham. Finally, losing all patience, he
leaned out of the window, and in his most magisterial manner said, 'Is
it intended that this train shall move on to-night?' The porter
addressed, not knowing the great man, tartly replied, 'Put in thy big
white yedd, and mebbe the train'll start.'"</p>

<p>Due at Loch Awe 1.32; half-past one when we strolled into Connel Ferry
station, sixteen miles short of that point. Two more stations before we
reach Loch Awe.</p>

<p>"Always heard it was a far cry to Loch Awe", said Sark, undauntedly
determined to regard matters cheerfully. </p>

<p>"You haven't come to the hill yet", said a sepulchral voice in the
corner.</p>

<p>"What hill?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll see soon enough. It's where we usually get out and walk. If
there are on board the train any chums of the guard or driver, they are
expected to lend a shoulder to help the train up."</p>

<p>Ice once broken, stranger became communicative. Told us his melancholy
story. Had been a W.S. in Edinburgh. Five years ago, still in prime of
life, bought a house at Oban; obliged to go to Edinburgh once, sometimes
twice, a week. Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> thrice in all that time had train made junction
with Edinburgh train at Stirling. Appetite failed; flesh fell away;
spirits went down to water level. Through looking out of window on
approaching Stirling, in hope of seeing South train waiting, eyes put on
that gaze of strained anxiety that had puzzled me. Similarly habit
contracted of involuntarily jerking up right hand with gesture designed
to arrest departing train.</p>

<p>"Last week, coming north from Edinburgh", said the hapless passenger,
"we were two hours late at Loch Awe. 'A little late to-day, aren't we?'
I timidly observed to the guard. 'Ou aye! we're a bit late,' he said.
'Ye see, we had a lot of rams, and we couldna' get baith them and you up
the hill; so we left ye at Tyndrum, and ran the rams through first, and
then came back for ye.'"</p>

<p>Fifty minutes late at Killin Junction. So far from making up time lost
at Oban, more lost at every wayside station.</p>

<p>"I hope we shan't miss the train at Stirling?" I anxiously inquired of
guard.</p>

<p>"Weel, no", said he, looking at his watch. "I dinna think ye'll hae
managed that yet."</p>

<p>This spoken in soothing tones, warm from the kindly Scottish heart.
Hadn't yet finally lost chance of missing train at Stirling that should
enable us to keep our tryst at Woodside. But no need for despair. A
little more dawdling and it would be done.</p>

<p>Done it was. When we reached Stirling, porters complacently announced
English mail had left quarter of an hour ago. As for stationmaster, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
was righteously indignant with inconsiderate travellers who showed
disposition to lament their loss.</p>

<p>"Good night", said cadaverous fellow-passenger, feebly walking out of
darkling station. "Hope you'll get a bed somewhere. Having been going up
and down line for five years, I keep a bedroom close by. Cheaper in the
end. I shall get on in the morning."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Mere Invention.</span>&mdash;Up the Highlands way there is, in wet weather, a
handsome cataract, the name whereof is spelt anyhow you like, but is
pronounced "Fyres." There is not much water in hot weather, and then art
assists nature, and a bucket or so of the fluid is thrown over for the
delectation of tourists. One of them, observing this arrangement, said
that the proprietor</p>

<blockquote><p>"Began to pail his ineffectual Fyres." </p></blockquote>

<p>[This story is quite false, which would be of no consequence, but that
every Scottish tourist knows it to be false. Our contributor should
really be more careful.]</p>

<h2>FROM OUR BILIOUS CONTRIBUTOR.</h2>

<center><i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch.</span></center>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear sir</span>,
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p>Embarking at Bannavie very early in the morning&mdash;<i>diluculo surgere
saluberrimum est</i>, but it is also particularly disagreeable&mdash;I was upon
the canal of the Caledonians, on my way to the capital of the Highlands.
This is the last voyage which, upon this occasion, I shall have the
pleasure of describing. The vessel was commanded by Captain Turner, who
is a remarkable meteorologist, and has emitted some wonderful weather
prophecies. Having had, moreover, much opportunity of observing
character, in his capacity of captain of boats chiefly used by tourists,
he is well acquainted with the inmost nature of the aristocracy and
their imitators. Being myself of an aristo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>cratic turn of mind (as well
as shape of body) it was refreshing to me to sit with him on the bridge
and speak of our titled friends.</p>

<p>Fort Augustus, which we passed, is not called so from having been built
by the Roman Emperor of that name, quite the reverse. The next object of
interest is a thing called the Fall of Foyers, which latter word is
sounded like fires, and the announcement to Cockneys that they are going
to see the affair, leads them to expect something of a pyrotechnic
character. It is nothing of that sort. The steamboat is moored, you rush
on shore, and are instantly arrested by several pikemen&mdash;I do not mean
soldiers of a mediæval date, but fellows at a gate, who demand fourpence
apiece from everybody landing in those parts. Being in Scotland, this
naturally made me think I had come to Johnny Groat's house, but no such
thing, and I have no idea of the reason of this highway robbery, or why
a very dirty card should have been forced upon me in proof that I had
submitted. We were told to go up an ascending road, and then to climb a
dreadfully steep hill, and that then we should see something. For my own
part, I felt inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> to see everybody blowed first, but being
over-persuaded, I saw everybody blowed afterwards, for that hill is a
breather, I can tell you. However, I rushed up like a mounting deer, and
when at the top was told to run a little way down again. I did, and saw
the sight. You have seen the cataracts of the Nile? It's not like them.
You have seen a cataract in a party's eye. It's not like that. Foyers is
a very fine waterfall, and worthy of much better verses than some which
Mr. Burns addressed to it in his English style, which is vile. Still,
the waterfall at the Colosseum, Regent's Park, is a good one, and has
this advantage, that you can sit in a chair and look at it as long as
you like, whereas you walk a mile to Foyers, goaded by the sailors from
the vessel, who are perpetually telling you to make haste, and you are
allowed about three minutes and fourteen seconds to gaze upon the scene,
when the sailors begin to goad you back again, frightening you with
hints that the captain will depart without you. Precious hot you come on
board, with a recollection of a mass of foam falling into an abyss. That
is not the way to see Foyers, and I hereby advise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> all tourists who are
going to stop at Inverness, to drive over from thence, take their time
at the noble sight, and do the pier-beggars out of their fourpences.</p>

<p>The stately towers of the capital of the Highlands are seen on our
right. A few minutes more, and we are moored. Friendly voices hail us,
and also hail a vehicle. We are borne away. There is news for us. We are
forthwith&mdash;even in that carriage, were it possible&mdash;to induct ourselves
into the black tr × ws × rs of refined life and the white cravat of
graceful sociality, and to accompany our host to the dinner of the
Highland railwaymen. <i>We</i> rail. We have not come six hundred miles to
dress for dinner. Our host is of a different opinion, and being a host
in himself, conquers our single-handed resistance. We attend the dinner,
and find ourselves among Highland chieftains plaided and plumed in their
"tartan array." (Why doesn't Horatio MacCulloch, noble artist and
Highland-man, come to London and be <i>our</i> tartan R.A.?) We hear wonders
of the new line, which is to save folks the trouble of visiting the lost
tribe at Aberdeen, and is to take them direct from Inverness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> Perth,
through wonderful scenery. We see a programme of toasts, to the number
of thirty-four, which of course involves sixty-eight speeches. There is
also much music by the volunteers&mdash;not, happily, by bag-pipers. We
calculate, on the whole, that the proceedings will be over about four in
the morning. Ha! ha! <i>Dremacky</i>. There is a <i>deus ex machiná</i> literally,
a driver on an engine, and he starts at ten. Numbers of the guests must
go with him. <i>Claymore!</i> We slash out the toasts without mercy&mdash;without
mercy on men set down to speak and who have spoiled their dinner by
thinking over their <i>impromptus</i>. But there is one toast which shall be
honoured, yea, with the Highland honours. <i>Mr. Punch's</i> health is
proposed. It is well that this handsome hall is built strongly, or the
Highland maidens should dance here no more. The shout goes up for <i>Mr.
Punch</i>.</p>

<p>I believe that I have mentioned to you, once or twice, that I am an
admirable speaker, but upon this occasion I surpassed myself&mdash;I was in
fact, as the Covent Garden play-bills say, "unsurpassingly successful."
Your interests were safe in my hands. I believe that no person present
heard a syllable of what I said. It was this:</p>

<blockquote><p>[It may have been, but as what our correspondent has been pleased
to send as his speech would occupy four columns, we prefer to leave
it to immortality in the excellent newspaper of which he sends us a
"cutting." We incline to think that he <i>was</i> weak enough to say
what he says he said, because he could not have invented and
written it out after a Highland dinner, and it was published next
morning. It is extremely egotistical, and not in the least
entertaining&mdash;<i>Ed.</i>] </p></blockquote>

<p>Among the guests was a gentleman who owns the mare who will certainly
win the Cesarewitch. <i>I know this for a fact</i>, and I advise you to put
your money on <i>Lioness</i>. His health was proposed, and he returned thanks
with the soul of wit. I hope he recollects the hope expressed by the
proposer touching a certain saddling-bell. I thought it rather strong in
"Bible-loving Scotland", but to be sure, we were in the Highlands, which
are England, or at all events where the best English spoken in Scotland
is heard.</p>

<p>We reached our house at an early hour, and I was lulled to a gentle
slumber by the sound of the river Ness. This comes out of Loch Ness, and
in the latest geographical work with which I am acquainted, namely,
"Geography Anatomiz'd, by Pat. Gordon, M.A.F.R.S. Printed for Andr.
Bell, at the Cross Keys and Bible in Cornhill, and R. Smith, under the
Royal Exchange, 1711", I read that "towards the north-west part of
<i>Murray</i> is the famous <i>Lough-Ness</i> which never freezeth, but retaineth
its natural heat, even in the extremest cold of winter, and in many
places this lake hath been sounded with a line of 500 fathom, but no
bottom can be found" (just as in the last rehearsal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> of the artisans'
play in the <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>), but I believe that recent
experiments have been more successful, and that though no lead plummet
would go so deep, a volume by a very particular friend of mine was
fastened to the line, and descended to the bottom in no time. I will
mention his name if he is not kind to my next work, but at present I
have the highest esteem and respect for him. I only show him that I know
this little anecdote.</p>

<p>There were what are called Highland games to be solemnised in Inverness.
I resolved to attend them, and, if I saw fit, to join in them. But I was
informed by a Highland friend of mine, Laidle of Toddie, a laird much
respected, that all competitors must appear in the kilt. As my own
graceful proportions would look equally well in any costume, this
presented no difficulty, and I marched off to Mr. Macdougall, the great
Highland costumier, and after walking through a dazzling array of Gaelic
glories, I said, mildly, "Can you make me a Highland dress?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, in a few hours", said Mr. Macdougall; but somehow I fancied
that he did not seem to think that I was displaying any vast amount of
sense.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
<p>"Then, please to make me one, very handsome", said I; "and send it home
to-night." And I was going out of the warehouse.</p>

<p>"But, sir", said Mr. Macdougall, "do you belong to any clan, or what
tartan will you have?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Macdougall", said I, "it may be that I do belong to a clan, or am
affiliated to one. It may be, that like Edward Waverley, I shall be
known hereafter as the friend of the sons (and daughters) of the
clan &mdash;&mdash;. It may be that if war broke out between that clan and another,
I would shout our war-cry, and, drawing my claymore, would walk into the
hostile clan like one o'clock. But at present that is a secret, and I
wear not the garb of any clan in particular. Please to make me up a
costume out of the garbs of several clans, but be sure you put the
brightest colours, as they suit my complexion."</p>

<p>I am bound to say that though Mr. Macdougall firmly declined being party
to this arrangement, which he said would be inartistic, he did so with
the utmost courtesy. My opinion is, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> thought I was a little
cracked. Many persons have thought that, but there is no foundation for
the suspicion.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Macdougall", says I, "I am a Plantagenet by descent, and
one of my ancestors was hanged in the time of George the Second. Do
those facts suggest anything to you in the way of costume?"</p>

<p>"The first does not", he said, "but the second may. A good many persons
had the misfortune to be hanged about the time you mention, and for the
same reason. I suppose your ancestor died for the Stuarts."</p>

<p>"No, sir, he died for a steward. The unfortunate nobleman was most
iniquitously destroyed for shooting a plebeian of the name of Johnson,
for which reason I hate everybody of that name, from Ben downwards, and
will not have a Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i> in my house."</p>

<p>"Then, sir", says Mr. Macdougall, "the case is clear. You can mark your
sense of the conduct of the sovereign who executed your respected
relative. You can assume the costume of his chief enemies. You can wear
the Stuart tartan."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hm", says I. "I should look well in it, no doubt; but then I have no
hostility to the present House of Brunswick."</p>

<p>"Why", says he, laughing; "Her Majesty dresses her own princes in the
Stuart tartan. I ought to know that."</p>

<p>"Then that's settled", I replied.</p>

<p>Ha! You would indeed have been proud of your contributor, had you seen
him splendidly arrayed in that gorgeous garb, and treading the heather
of Inverness High Street like a young mountaineer. He did not look then
like</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Notice to the Highlanders.</span>&mdash;Whereas Mr. Punch, through his "Bilious
Contributor", did on the 7th November, 1863, offer a prize of fifty
guineas to the best Highland player at Spellikins, in the games for
1873. And whereas Mr. Punch has had the money, with ten years' interest,
quite ready, and waiting to be claimed. And whereas no Highland player
at Spellikins appeared at the games of 1873. This to give notice that
Mr. Punch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> has irrevocably confiscated the money to his own sole and
peculiar use, and intends to use it in bribery at the next general
election. He begs to remark to the Highlands, in the words of his
ancestor, Robert Bruce, at Bannockburn&mdash;"There is a rose fallen from

<h2>THE HIGHLAND GAMES AT MACJIGGITY</h2>

<p>Whilst staying at MacFoozle Castle, my excellent host insisted that I
should accompany him to see the Highland games. The MacFoozle himself is
a typical Hielander, and appeared in a kilt and jelly-bag&mdash;philabeg, I
mean. Suggested to him that I should go, attired in pair of
bathing-drawers, Norfolk jacket, and Glengarry cap, but he, for some
inscrutable reason of his own, negatived the idea. Had half a mind to
dress in kilt myself, but finally decided against the national costume
as being too draughty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> Arrived on ground, and found that "tossing the
caber" was in full progress. Braw laddies struggled, in turn, with
enormous tree trunk. The idea of the contest is, that whoever succeeds
in killing the greatest number of spectators by hurling the tree on to
them, wins the prize. Fancy these laddies had been hung too long, or
else they were particularly braw. Moved up to windward of them promptly.</p>

<p>"Who is the truculent-looking villain with red whiskers?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Hush!" says my host, in awed tones. "That is the MacGinger himself!"</p>

<p>I grovel. Not that I have ever even heard his name before, but I don't
want to show my ignorance before the MacFoozle. The competition of
pipers was next in order, and I took to my heels and fled. Rejoined
MacFoozle half an hour later to witness the dancing. On a large raised
platform sat the judges, with the mighty MacGinger himself at their
head. Can't quite make out whether the dance is a Reel, a Strathspey, a
Haggis, or a Skirl&mdash;sure it is one or the other. Just as I ask for
information, amid a confusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> whirl of arms and legs and "Hoots!" a
terrific crack is heard, and the platform, as though protesting at the
indignities heaped upon it, suddenly gives way, and in a moment,
dancers, pipers, and judges are hurled in a confused and struggling heap
to the ground. The MacGinger falls upon some bag-pipes, which emit
dismal groanings beneath his massive weight. This ends the dancing
prematurely, and a notice is immediately put up all round the grounds
that (to take its place) "There will be another competition of
bag-pipes." I read it, evaded the MacFoozle, and fled.</p>

<h2>THE THING TO DO IN SCOTLAND</h2>

<center><i>(More Leaves from the Highland Journal of Toby, M.P.)</i></center>

<p><i>Quiverfield, Haddingtonshire, Monday.</i>&mdash;You can't spend twenty-four
hours at Quiverfield without having borne in upon you the truth that the
only thing to do in Scotland is to play goff. (On other side of Tweed
they call it golf. Here we are too much in a hurry to get at the game to
spend time on unnecessary consonant.) The waters of what Victor Hugo
called "The First of the Fourth" lave the links at Quiverfield. Blue as
the Mediterranean they have been in a marvellous autumn, soon to lapse
into November. We can see the Bass Rock from the eighth hole, and can
almost hear the whirr of the balls skimming with swallow flight over the
links at North Berwick.</p>

<p>Prince Arthur here to-day, looking fully ten years younger than when I
last saw him at Westminster. Plays through live-long day, and drives off
fourteen miles for dinner at Whittinghame, thinking no more of it than
if he were crossing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> Palace Yard. Our host, Waverley Pen, is happy in
possession of links at his park gates. All his own, for self and
friends. You step through the shrubbery, and there are the far-reaching
links; beyond them the gleaming waters of the Forth. Stroll out
immediately after breakfast to meet the attendant caddies; play goff
till half-past one; reluctantly break off for luncheon; go back to
complete the fearsome foursome; have tea brought out to save time; leave
off in bare time to dress for dinner; talk goff at dinner; arrange
matches after dinner; and the new morning finds the caddies waiting as
before.</p>

<h3>Fingen's finger.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Decidedly the only thing to do in Scotland is to play goff.</p>

<p><i>Deeside, Aberdeenshire, Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Fingen, M.P., once told an abashed
House of Commons that he "owned a mountain in Scotland." Find, on
visiting him in his ancestral home, that he owns a whole range. Go up
one or two of them; that comparatively easy; difficulty presents itself
when we try to get down. Man and boy, Fingen has lived here fifty years;
has not yet acquired knowledge necessary to guide a party home after
ascending one of his mountains. Walking up in cool of afternoon, we
usually get home sore-footed and hungry about midnight.</p>

<p>"Must be going now", says Fingen, M.P., when we have seen view from top
of mountain. "Just time to get down before dark. But I know short cut;
be there in a jiffy. Come along."</p>

<p>We come along. At end of twenty minutes find ourselves in front of
impassable gorge.</p>

<p>"Ha!" says Fingen, M.P., cheerily. "Must have taken wrong turn; better
go back and start again."</p>

<p>All very well to say go back; but where were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> we? Fingen, M.P., knows;
wets his finger; holds it up.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he says, with increased joyousness of manner; "the wind is blowing
that way, is it? Then we turn to the left."</p>

<p>Another twenty minutes stumbling through aged heather. Path trends
downwards.</p>

<p>"That's all right", says Fingen, M.P.; "must lead on to the road."</p>

<p>Instead of which we nearly fall into a bubbling burn. Go back again;
make bee line up acclivity nearly as steep as side of house; find
ourselves again on top of mountain.</p>

<p>"How lucky!" shouts Fingen, M.P., beaming with delight.</p>

<p>As if we had been trying all this time to get to top of mountain instead
of to bottom!</p>

<p>Wants to wet his finger again and try how the wind lies. We protest. Let
us be saved that at least. Fingen leads off in quite another direction.
By rocky pathway which threatens sprains; through bushes and brambles
that tear the clothes; by dangerous leaps from rock to rock he brings us
to apparently impenetrable hedge. We stare forlorn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ha!" says Fingen, M.P., more aggressively cheerful than ever. "The road
is on other side. Thought we would come upon it somewhere." Somehow or
other we crawl through.</p>

<p>"Nothing like having an eye to the lay of country", says Fingen, M.P.,
as we limp along the road. "It's a sort of instinct, you know. If I
hadn't been with you, you might have had to camp out all night on the
mountain."</p>

<p>They don't play goff at Deeside. They bicycle. Down the long avenue with
spreading elm trees deftly trained to make triumphal arches, the
bicycles come and go. Whipsroom, M.P., thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> opportunity convenient
for acquiring the art of cycling. W. is got up with consummate art. Has
had his trousers cut short at knee in order to display ribbed stockings
of rainbow hue. Loose tweed-jacket, blood-red necktie, white felt hat
with rim turned down all round, combine to lend him air of a Drury Lane
bandit out of work. Determined to learn to ride the bicycle, but spends
most of the day on his hands and knees, or on his back. Looking down
avenue at any moment pretty sure to find W. either running into the iron
fence, coming off sideways, or bolting head first over the handles of
his bike. Get quite new views of him fore-shortened in all possible
ways, some that would be impossible to any but a man of his
determination.</p>

<h3>The crack of the whip('s pate!)</h3>
</div>

<p>"Never had a man stay in the house", says Fingen, M.P., ruefully, "who
so cut up the lawn with his head, or indented the gravel with his elbows
and his knees."</p>

<p>Evidently I was mistaken about goff. Cycling's the thing in Scotland.</p>

<p><i>Goasyoucan, Inverness-shire, Saturday.</i>&mdash;Wrong again. Not goff nor
cycling is the thing to do in Scotland. It's stalking. Soon learn that
great truth at Goasyoucan. The hills that encircle the house densely
populated with stags. To-day three guns grassed nine, one a royal. This
the place to spend a happy day, crouching down among the heather
awaiting the fortuitous moment. Weather no object. Rain or snow out you
go, submissive to guidance and instruction of keeper; by comparison with
whose tyranny life of the ancient galley-slave was perfect freedom.</p>

<p>Consummation of human delight this, to lie prone on your face amid the
wet heather, with the rain pattering down incessantly, or the snow
pitilessly falling, covering you up flake by flake as if it were a robin
and you a babe in the wood. Mustn't stir; mustn't speak; if you can
conveniently dispense with the operation, better not breathe. Sometimes,
after morning and greater part of afternoon thus cheerfully spent, you
may get a shot; even a stag. Also you may not; or, having attained the
first, may miss the latter. At any rate you have spent a day of
exhilarating delight.</p>

<p>Stalking is evidently the thing to do in Scotland. It's a far cry to the
Highlands. Happily there is Arthur's Seat by Edinburgh town where
beginners can practise, and old hands may feign delight of early
triumphs.</p>

<h2>NOTES FROM THE HIGHLANDS</h2>

<p><i>Alt-na-blashy.</i>&mdash;The aqueous and igneous agencies seem to be combined
in these quarters, for since the rain we hear of a great increase of
burns. In default of the moors we fall back on the kitchen and the
cellar. I need hardly add that dry wines are almost exclusively used by<a href="images/i_074.png"></a>
our party, and moist sugar is generally avoided. Dripping, too, is
discontinued, and everything that is likely to whet the appetite is at a
discount.</p>

<p><i>Drizzle-arich.</i>&mdash;A Frenchman, soaked out of our bothy by the moisture
of the weather, was overheard to exclaim "<i>Après moi le déluge.</i>"</p>

<p><i>Inverdreary.</i>&mdash;Greatly to the indignation of their chief, several of
the "Children of the Mist", in this romantic but rainy region, have

<h2>TWO ON A TOUR</h2>

<p>"Can you tell me which is Croft Lochay?"</p>

<p>The smith leant on his pitchfork&mdash;he had been up at the hay&mdash;and eyed
Gwendolen and myself with friendly interest.</p>

<p>"Ye'll be the gentry from London Mistress McDiarmat is expectin'?"</p>

<p>"And which is the way to her house?"</p>

<p>"Well", said the smith, shading his eyes as he peered up at the Ben, "ye
can't see it rightly from here, as it lies behind yon knowe. It's a
whole year whatever since I hev not been up myself; but if you follow
the burn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I glanced at Gwen and saw that she shared my satisfaction. To cross the
edge of civilisation had for months past been our hearts' desire; and to
have achieved a jumping-off place only approachable by a burn exceeded
our wildest ambitions.</p>

<p>We thanked the smith, and set off on our expedition up the mountain
side.</p>

<p>"We twa hae paidlit in the burn", sang Gwendolen as she skipped like a
goat from stone to stone. "O Jack, isn't it too primitive and
delightful!"</p>

<p>"Rather", said I, inhaling great draughts of the mountain air.</p>

<p>"Aren't you hungry?"</p>

<p>"Rather", I repeated. "Wonder what there'll be to eat."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care what it is. Anything will be delicious. Is that the
house, do you think?"</p>

<p>I looked up and saw above us a low white-washed shanty covered with
thatch which was kept in its place by a network of laths. A few heavy
stones were evidently designed to keep the roof from blowing off in
winter storms.</p>

<p>"No", said Gwen. "That must be the cowhouse byre, don't you call it?"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure", said I.</p>

<p>While we were still uncertain, a figure came to the door and bade us
welcome.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
<p>"Come in, come in. Ye'll be tired with the travelling, and ye'll like to
see the rooms."</p>

<p>We acquiesced, and Mistress McDiarmat led the way into the cowhouse.</p>

<p>"Shoo!" she cried as she opened the door of the bedroom. "Get away,
Speckle! The hens <i>will</i> lay their bit egg on the bed, sir."</p>

<p>"What fresh eggs we shall get!" cried Gwen, delighted with this fresh
proof of rusticity and with the Gaelic gutturals with which Mistress
McDiarmat emphasized her remarks to Speckle.</p>

<p>The "other end" was furnished with two hard chairs, a table and a bed.</p>

<p>"Fancy a bed in the dining-room and hens in your bed!" said Gwen, in the
highest of spirits. "And here comes tea! Eggs and bacon&mdash;Ah! how lovely
they smell, and how much nicer than horrid, stodgy dinners! And
oatcakes&mdash;and jelly&mdash;and the lightest feathery scones! O Jack, isn't it
heavenly?"</p>

<p>"Rather", I agreed, beginning the meal with tremendous gusto. The eggs
and bacon disappeared in the twinkling of an eye, and then we fell to on
the light feathery scones. "Wish we hadn't wasted a fortnight's time
and money in ruinous Highland hotels. Wonder what Schiehallion thinks of
hot baths and late dinners, not to speak of waiters and wine-lists."</p>

<p>"I suppose", remarked Gwendolen, "one <i>could</i> get a bath at the
Temperance Inn we passed on the road?"</p>

<p>"Baths!" cried I. "Why, my dear, one only has to go and sit under the
neighbouring waterfall." Gwen did not laugh, and looking up I saw she
had stopped in the middle of a scone on which she had embarked with
great appetite.</p>

<p>"Try an oat-cake", I suggested.</p>

<p>"No, thanks", said Gwen.</p>

<p>"A little more jelly?"</p>

<p>Gwen shook her head.</p>

<p>I finished my meal in silence and pulled out my pipe.</p>

<p>"Going to smoke in here?" asked Gwen.</p>

<p>"It's raining outside, my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. But remember this is my bedroom. I decline to sleep with
hens."</p>

<p>I put the pipe away and prepared for conversation. </p>

<p>"Can't you sit still?" asked Gwen after a long pause.</p>

<p>"This chair is very hard, dear."</p>

<p>"So is mine."</p>

<p>"Don't you think we might sit on the bed?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I shouldn't sleep a wink if we disarranged the clothes,
and only an expert can re-make a chaff bed."</p>

<p>"Wish we had something to read", I remarked, after another long pause.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you expect a circulating library on the top of Ben-y-Gloe?"</p>

<p>I began to realise that Gwen was no longer in a conversational mood, and
made no further efforts to break the silence. Half-an-hour later Gwen
came across the room and laid her hand on my shoulder. "What are you
reading, dear?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I find we can get a train from Struan to-morrow afternoon which catches
the London connection at Perth when the train's not more than two hours
late."</p>

<p>"We can't risk that. Isn't there a train in the morning?"</p>

<p>"It would mean leaving this at five."</p>

<p>"So much the better. O Jack, if I eat another meal like that it will be
fatal. To think we shall be back in dear old Chelsea to-morrow!"</p>

<p>Before going out, Mr. Briggs and his friends have a quiet
chat about deer-stalking generally. He listens with much interest to
some pleasing anecdotes about the little incidents frequently met
with&mdash;such as balls going through caps&mdash;toes being shot
off!&mdash;occasionally being gored by the antlers of infuriate stags, &amp;c.,

<p>Mr. Briggs, previous to going through his course of

annual Highland Games are being held. The programme being a long
one, there are generally three events being contested in various
parts of the ground at the same time. On the benches immediately
below the Grand Stand are seated two Drumquhidder worthies</i>, <span class="smcap">Mr.

<p><i>Mr. Havers</i> <i>(in allusion to the dozen or so of drags, landaus, and
waggonettes on the ground)</i>. There's a number o' machines hier the day,

<h2>MORE SKETCHES FROM SCOTLAND</h2>

<center><span class="smcap">On a Callander Char-a-banc.</span></center>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>In front of the Trossachs Hotel. The few passengers bound
for Callander have been sitting for several minutes on the coach
"Fitz-James" in pelting rain, resignedly wondering when the driver
will consider them sufficiently wet to start.</i> </p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Head Boots (to the driver).</i> There's another to come yet; he'll no
be lang now. <i>(The cause of the delay comes down the hotel steps, and
surveys the vehicle and its occupants with a surly scowl.)</i> Up with ye,
sir, plenty of room on the second seats.</p>

<p><i>The Surly Passenger.</i> And have all the umbrellas behind dripping on my
hat! No, thank you, I'm going in front. <i>(He mounts, and takes up the
apron.)</i> Here, driver, just look at this apron&mdash;it's sopping wet!</p>

<p><i>The Driver (tranquilly).</i> Aye, I'm thinking it wull ha' got a bet
domp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Surly P.</i> Well, I'm not going to have this over me. Haven't you got
a <i>dry</i> one somewhere?</p>

<p><i>The Driver.</i> There'll be dry ones at Collander.</p>

<p><i>The Surly P. (with a snort).</i> At Callander! Much good that is! <i>(With
crushing sarcasm.</i>) If I'm to keep dry on this concern, it strikes me
I'd better get inside the boot at once!</p>

<p><i>The Driver (with the air of a man who is making a concession).</i> Ou aye,
ye can get inside the boot if ye've a mind to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

</div>

<blockquote>[<i>The coach starts, and is presently stopped at a corner to take up a
male and a female passenger, who occupy the seats immediately behind the
Surly Passenger.</i></blockquote>

<p><i>The Female P. (enthusiastically, to her companion).</i> There's dear old
Mrs. Macfarlane, come out to see the last of us! Look at her standing
out there in the garden, all in the rain. That's what I always say about
the Scotch&mdash;they <i>are</i> warm-hearted!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>She waves her hand in farewell to some distant object.</i></p>

<p><i>Her Companion. That</i> ain't her; that's an old apple-tree in the garden
<i>you</i>'re waving to. <i>She's</i> keeping indoors&mdash;and shows her sense too.</p>

<p><i>The Female P. (disgusted).</i> Well, I <i>do</i> think after our being at the
farm a fortnight and all, she <i>might</i>&mdash;&mdash;But that's Scotch all <i>over</i>,
that is; get all they can out of you, and then, for anything <i>they</i>
care&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>The Surly P.</i> I don't know whether you are aware of it, ma'am, but that
umbrella of yours is sending a constant trickle down the back of my
neck, which is <i>most</i> unpleasant!</p>

<p><i>The Female P.</i> I'm sorry to hear it, sir, but it's no worse for you
than it is for me. I've got somebody else's umbrella dripping down <i>my</i>
back, and <i>I</i> don't complain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Surly P.</i> I <i>do</i>, ma'am, for, being in front, I haven't even the
poor consolation of feeling that my umbrella is a nuisance to anybody.</p>

<p><i>A Sardonic P. (in the rear, politely).</i> On the contrary, sir, I find it
a most pleasing object to contemplate. Far more picturesque, I don't
doubt, than any scenery it may happen to conceal.</p>

<p><i>A Chatty P. (to the driver; not because he cares, but simply for the
sake of conversation).</i> What fish do you catch in that river there?</p>

<p><i>The Driver (with an effort).</i> There'll be troots, an', maybe, a pairrch
or two.</p>

<p><i>The Chatty P.</i> Perch? Ah, that's rather like a goldfish in shape, eh?</p>

<p><i>Driver (cautiously).</i> Aye, it would be that.</p>

<p><i>Chatty P.</i> Only considerably bigger, of course.</p>

<p><i>Driver (evasively).</i> Pairrch is no a verra beg fesh.</p>

<p><i>Chatty P.</i> But bigger than goldfish.</p>

<p><i>Driver (more confidently).</i> Ou aye, they'll be begger than goldfesh.</p>

<p><i>Chatty P. (persistently).</i> You've seen goldfish&mdash;know what they're
like, eh?</p>

<p><i>Driver (placidly).</i> I canna say I do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>They pass a shooting party with beaters.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chatty P. (as before).</i> What are they going to shoot?</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> They'll jist be going up to the hells for a bet grouse
drivin'.</p>

<p><i>A Lady P.</i> I wonder why they carry those poles with the red and yellow
flags. I suppose they're to warn tourists to keep out of range when they
begin firing at the butts. I know they <i>have</i> butts up on the moor,
because I've seen them. Just look at those birds running after that man
throwing grain for them. Would those be <i>grouse</i>?</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> Ye'll no find grouse so tame as that, mem; they'll jist be
phaysants.</p>

<p><i>The Lady P.</i> Poor dear things! why, they're as tame as chickens. It
<i>does</i> seem so cruel to kill them!</p>

<p><i>Her Comp.</i> Well, but they kill chickens, occasionally.</p>

<p><i>The Lady P.</i> Not with a horrid gun; and, besides, that's such a totally
different thing.</p>

<p><i>The Chatty P.</i> What do you call that mountain, driver, eh?</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> Yon hell? I'm no minding its name.</p>

<p><i>The Surly P.</i> You don't seem very ready in pointing out the objects of
interests on the route, I must say.</p>

<p><i>Driver (modestly).</i> There'll be them on the corch that know as much
aboot it as myself. <i>(After a pause&mdash;to vindicate his character as a
cicerone.)</i> Did ye nottice a bit building at the end of the loch over
yonder?</p>

<p><i>The Surly P.</i> No, I didn't.</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> Ye might ha' seen it, had ye looked.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He relapses into a contented silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chatty P.</i> Anything remarkable about the building?</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> It was no the building that's remairkable. <i>(After a severe
struggle with his own reticence.)</i> It was jist the spoat. 'Twas there
<i>Roderick Dhu</i> fought <i>Fitz-James</i> after convoying him that far on his
way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>The Surly Passenger snorts as though he didn't consider this
information.</i></p>

<p><i>The Lady P. (who doesn't seem to be up in her "Lady of the Lake").
Fitz-James who?</i></p>

<p><i>Her Comp.</i> I fancy he's the man who owns this line of coaches. There's
his name on the side of this one.</p>

<p><i>The Lady P.</i> And I saw <i>Roderick Dhu's</i> on another coach. I <i>thought</i>
it sounded familiar, somehow. He must be the <i>rival</i> proprietor, I
suppose. I wonder if they've made it up yet.</p>

<p><i>The Driver (to the Surly Passenger, with another outburst of
communicativeness).</i> Yon stoan is called "Sawmson's Putting Stoan." He
hurrled it up to the tope of the hell, whaur it's bided ever sence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>The Surly Passenger receives this information with an incredulous
grunt.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Lady P.</i> What a magnificent old ruin that is across the valley,
some ancient castle, evidently; they can't build like that nowadays!</p>

<p><i>The Driver.</i> That's the Collander Hydropawthec, mem; burrnt doon two or
three years back.</p>

<p><i>The Lady P. (with a sense of the irony of events).</i> <i>Burnt</i> down! A
Hydropathic! Fancy!</p>

<p><i>Male P. (as they enter Callander and pass a trim villa).</i> There,
<i>that's</i> Mr. Figgis's place.</p>

<p><i>His Comp.</i> What&mdash;<i>that</i>? Why, it's quite a <i>bee-yutiful</i> place, with
green venetians, and a conservatory, and a croaky lawn, and everything!
Fancy all that belonging to <i>him</i>! It's well to be a grocer&mdash;in <i>these</i>
parts, seemingly!</p>

<p><i>Male P.</i> Ah, <i>we</i> ought to come up and start business here; it 'ud be
better than being in the Caledonian Road!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>They meditate for the remainder of the journey upon the caprices of
Fortune with regard to grocery profits in Caledonia and the Caledonian
Road respectively.</i></p>

<h2>EN ÉCOSSE</h2>

<center><i>À Monsieur Punch</i></center>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mister</span>,&mdash;I come of to make a little voyage in Scotland. Ah, the
beautiful country of Sir Scott, Sir Wallace, and Sir Burns! I am gone to
render visit to one of my english friends, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> charming boy&mdash;<i>un charmant
garçon</i>&mdash;and his wife, a lady very instructed and very spiritual, and
their childs. I adore them, the dear little english childs, who have the
cheeks like some roses, and the hairs like some flax, as one says in
your country, all buckled&mdash;<i>bouclés</i>, how say you?</p>

<p>I go by the train of night&mdash;in french one says "<i>le sleeping</i>"&mdash;to
Edimbourg, and then to Calendar, where I attend to find a coach&mdash;in
french one says "<i>un mail</i>" or "<i>un fourinhand</i>." <i>Nom d'une pipe</i>, it
is one of those ridicule carriages, called in french "<i>un breack</i>" and
in english a char-à-banc&mdash;that which the english pronounce
"<i>tcherribaingue</i>"&mdash;which attends us at the going out of the station! Eh
well, in voyage one must habituate himself to all! But a such carriage
discovered&mdash;<i>découverte</i>&mdash;seems to me well unuseful in a country where
he falls of rain without cease.</p>

<p>Before to start I demand of all the world some <i>renseignements</i> on the
scottish climate, and all the world responds me, "All-days of the rain."
By consequence I procure myself some impermeable vestments, one
mackintosch coat, one mackintosch cape of Inverness, one mackintosch
covering of voyage, one south-western hat, some umbrellas, some gaiters,
and many pairs of boots very thick&mdash;not boots of town, but veritable
"shootings."</p>

<p>I arrive at Edimbourg by a morning of the most sads; the sky grey, the
earth wet, the air humid. Therefore I propose to myself to search at
Calender a place at the interior, <i>et voilà</i>&mdash;and see there&mdash;the
<i>breack</i> has no interior! There is but that which one calls a "boot",
and me, Auguste, can I to lie myself there at the middle of the
baggages? Ah no! Thus I am forced to endorse&mdash;<i>endosser</i>&mdash;my impermeable
vestments and to protect myself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> head by my south-western hat. Then,
holding firmly the most strong of my umbrellas, I say to the coacher,
"He goes to fall of the rain, is it not?" He makes a sign of head of not
to comprehend. Ah, for sure, he is scottish! I indicate the sky and my
umbrella, and I say "Rain?" and then he comprehends. "<i>Eh huile</i>", he
responds to me, "<i>ah canna sé, mébi huile no hé meukl the dé</i>." I write
this phonetically, for I comprehend not the scottish language. What
droll of conversation! Him comprehends not the english; me I comprehend
not the scottish.</p>

<p>But I essay of new, "How many has he of it from here to the lake?"
<i>C'est inutile</i>&mdash;it is unuseful. I say, "Distance?" He comprehends.
"<i>Mébi oui taque toua hours</i>", says he; "<i>beutt yile no fache yoursel,
its no sé lang that yile bi ouishinn yoursel aoua</i>." <i>Quelle
langue</i>&mdash;what language, even to write phonetically! I comprehend one
sole word, "hours." Some hours! <i>Sapristi!</i> I say, "Hours?" He says
"<i>Toua</i>" all together, a monosyllable. <i>Sans aucune doute ça veut dire</i>
"twelve"&mdash;<i>douze</i>. Twelve hours on a <i>breack</i> in a such climate! Ah, no!
<i>C'est trop fort</i>&mdash;it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> too strong! "Hold", I cry myself, "attend, I
descend, I go not!" It is true that I see not how I can to descend, for
I am <i>entouré</i>&mdash;how say you? of voyagers. We are five on a bench, of the
most narrows, and me I am at the middle. And the bench before us is also
complete, and we touch him of the knees. And my neighbours carry on the
knees all sorts of packets, umbrellas, canes, sacks of voyage, &amp;c. <i>Il
n'y a pas moyen</i>&mdash;he has not there mean. And the coacher says me "<i>Na,
na, monne, yile no ghitt doun, yile djest baïd ouar yer sittinn.</i>" Then
he mounts to his place, and we part immediately. <i>Il va tomber de la
pluie! Douze heures! Mon Dieu, quel voyage!</i></p>

<h2>EN ÉCOSSE (ENCORE)</h2>

<center><i>À Monsieur Punch</i></center>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mister</span>,&mdash;I have spoken you of my departure from Calendar on the
<i>breack</i>. Eh, well, he rained not of the whole of the whole&mdash;<i>du tout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
du tout! Il faisait un temps superbe</i>&mdash;he was making a superb time, the
route was well agreeable, and the voyage lasted but two hours, and not
twelve. What droll of idea! In Scottish <i>twa</i> is two, not twelve. I was
so content to arrive so quick, and without to be wetted that I gave the
coacher a good to-drink&mdash;<i>un bon pourboire</i>&mdash;though before to start all
the voyagers had paid him a "tipp", that which he called a "driver's
fee." Again what droll of idea! To give the to-drink before to start,
and each one the same&mdash;six pennys.</p>

<p>My friend encountered me and conducted me to his house, where I have
passed fifteen days, a sojourn of the most agreeables. And all the time
almost not one sole drop of rain! <i>J'avais beau</i>&mdash;I had fine&mdash;to buy all
my impermeable vestments, I carry them never. One sole umbrella suffices
me, and I open him but two times. And yet one says that the Scotland is
a rainy country. It is perhaps a season <i>tout à fait</i>&mdash;all to
fact&mdash;exceptional. But fifteen days almost without rain! One would
believe himself at the border of the Mediterranean, absolutely at the
South. And I have eaten of the "porridg", me Auguste! <i>Partout</i> I essay
the dish of the country. I take at first a spoonful pure and simple. <i>Oh
la, la!</i> My friend offers me of the cream. It is well. Also of the salt.
<i>Quelle idée!</i> But no, before me I perceive a dish of <i>confiture</i>, that
which the Scottish call "marmaladde." <i>A la bonne heure!</i> With some
marmaladde, some cream, and much of sugar, I find that the "porridg" is
enough well, for I taste him no more.</p>

<p>One day we make an ascension, and we see many grouses. Only we can not
to shoot, for it is not yet the season of the huntings. It is but a hill
that we mount. The name appears me to be french, but bad written. "Ben
Venue", that is to say, "<i>Bienvenu</i>"&mdash;<i>soyez le bienvenu</i>. She is one of
the first of the Scottish hills, and she says "welcome" in french. It is
a pretty idea, and a politeness very amiable towards my country. I
salute the hospitable Scotland and I thank her. It is a great country,
of brave men, of charming women&mdash;ah, I recall to myself some eyes so
beautiful, some forms so attracting!&mdash;of ravishing landscapes, and, at
that epoch there, of a climate so delicious. She has one sole and one
great defect. The best Scottish hotels cost very dear, and, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> faith,
the two or three that I visited are not great thing like
comfortable&mdash;<i>ne sont pas grand'chose comme comfortable</i>!</p>

<p>One day we make a little excursion on the Lake of Lomond. The lake is
well beautiful, and the steamboat is excellent. But in one certain
hotel, in descending from a <i>breack</i>, and before to embark, we take the
"lunch." We bargain not, we ask not even the price, we eat at the <i>table
d'hôte</i> like all the world in Swiss, in France, even in Germany, when
there is but one half hour before the departure of the train or of the
boat. <i>Oh la, la!</i> I have eaten in the spanish hotels, on the steamboats
of the italian lakes, even in the <i>restaurants&mdash;mon Dieu!</i>&mdash;of the
english railways, but never, never&mdash;<i>au grand jamais</i>&mdash;have I eaten a
<i>déjeuner</i> like that! One dish I shall forget never; some exterior green
leaves of lettuce, without oil or vinegar, which they called a "salad."
<i>Parbleu</i>&mdash;by blue! In all the history of the world there has been but
one man who would have could to eat her with pleasure&mdash;Nabuchodonosor!</p>

<h2>THE DUKE OF ATHOLL'S SHILLING (1851)</h2>

<p>The <i>North British Mail</i> assures us that the Duke of Atholl exacts one
shilling a head from every person taking a walk in his ground at
Dunkeld. This is rather dear; but the impost would be insupportable if
his Grace insisted upon also showing himself for the money.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
